# Cancer Incidence in NHS Borders

## Purpose
The incidence of cancer in NHS Borders was investigated to help inform planning for the future provision of cancer treatment services (mock task).

## Usage
An html document containing a full report on the analysis was created using R Markdown. To view the analysis in html format download the cancer_incidence_data_investigation.html file from the analysis folder and open in a browser. The R code can be viewed by selecting view code from the drop down menus. 


## Key Findings

- The population of the Borders region of Scotland is rising.

- The number of incidences of cancer in NHS Borders is also rising but at a faster rate than can be accounted for by the population increase. 

- Bladder, prostrate, lung and breast cancer account of 60% of all incidences.

- A pronounced spike in the number of cancer diagnoses is observed every 3 years. Upon further analysis this spike was found to come from the breast cancer data and research indicates GP practices only take part in screening programmes every 3 years. 

- 11 out of 12 of the most common cancer types have increasing numbers of incidences (only leukaemias are not increasing).



## Further work 

- Conduct statistical analysis to determine which types of cancer are increasing at the fastest rate.

- Investigate SIRs to determine what types of cancer are higher in the NHS Borders region than they should be.

- Investigate non-melanoma skin cancer data.
